Versatile Ocean Simulation in Pure Python
=========================================

Veros, *the versatile ocean simulator*, aims to be the swiss army knife of ocean modeling. It is a full-fledged :abbr:`GCM (general circulation model)` that supports anything between highly idealized configurations and realistic set-ups, targeting students and seasoned researchers alike. Thanks to its seamless interplay with `Bohrium <https://github.com/bh107/bohrium>`_, Veros runs efficiently on your laptop, gaming PC (with experimental GPU support through OpenCL & CUDA), and small cluster. Veros has a clear focus on simplicity, usability, and adaptability - *because the Baroque is over*.

If you want to learn more about the background and capabilities of Veros, you should check out :doc:`quickstart/introduction`. If you are already convinced, you can jump right into action, and :doc:`learn how to get started <quickstart/get-started>` instead!
