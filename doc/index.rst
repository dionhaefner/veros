Versatile Ocean Simulation in Pure Python
=========================================

Veros, *the versatile ocean simulator*, aims to be the swiss army knife of ocean modeling. It is a full-fledged :abbr:`GCM (general circulation model)` that supports anything between highly idealized configurations and realistic set-ups. Thanks to its interplay with `Bohrium <https://github.com/bh107/bohrium>`_, Veros runs efficiently on your laptop, gaming PC (with experimental GPU support through OpenCL & CUDA), and small cluster. In short, we want to enable ocean modelling with a clear focus on simplicity, usability, and adaptability.

If you want to learn more about the background and capabilities of Veros, you should check out :doc:`quickstart/introduction`. If you are already convinced, you can jump right into action, and :doc:`learn how to get started <quickstart/get-started>` instead!
